Project Name: "Arduino based Fire Fighting Robot"

Introduction: The Firefighting Robot project aims to develop a robotic system that assists fire fighters in reaching difficult areas, reducing the risk to their lives, and lowering theburden on manpower. The robot will be equipped with sensors to detect fire, motors to navigate through obstacles, and a water pump to extinguish fires.

Problem Statement:
Firefighting robot include assisting firefighters in reaching difficult areas, reducing the risk to their lives, and lowering the burden on manpower.

Objectives:
1.	Enhance Firefighting Safety: Develop a robot that can assist firefighters by reaching difficult and dangerous areas, reducing the risk to human life.

2.	Improve Efficiency: Create a robot that can quickly detect and extinguish fires, thus lowering response times and increasing overall firefighting effectiveness.
3.	Reduce Manpower Burden: Minimize the number of firefighters needed onsite by deploying a robot to handle dangerous tasks, allowing human firefighters to focus on strategic operations.

4.	Leverage Technology: Utilize modern technology, such as sensors, microcontrollers, and actuators, to build an advanced and reliable firefighting robot.

5.	Cost-Effective: Reduces the cost associated with firefighting operations.

6.	Scalability: Ensure that the robot design is scalable and adaptable for various firefighting scenarios, from small indoor fires to larger outdoor incidents.
